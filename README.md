# Self-Driving Car Algorithm Using NeatJS

This repository contains a self-driving car algorithm implemented using the NeatJS library, developed as part of the **Robot Motion Planning course**. The algorithm is designed to control an autonomous vehicle's navigation and decision-making processes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the algorithm, ensure that you have the following installed:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Usage

To run the self-driving car algorithm, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This will load the algorithm and launch the simulated environment, allowing you to observe the autonomous vehicle's navigation.

## Implementation Details

The self-driving car algorithm is implemented using the NeatJS library, which is a JavaScript library for neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT). NEAT is a genetic algorithm that evolves artificial neural networks with increasing complexity over generations.

The algorithm takes input from various sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, radar) and processes this data to make decisions about steering, acceleration, and braking. The decisions are made by the evolved neural network, which has been trained using simulated scenarios and reinforcement learning techniques.

The implementation is contained within the `index.html` file, which includes the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the algorithm and the simulated environment.
